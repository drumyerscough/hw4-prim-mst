    Helper function to check the correctness of the adjacency matrix encoding an MST.
    Note that because the MST of a graph is not guaranteed to be unique, we cannot

        adj_mat: adjacency matrix of full graph
        mst: adjacency matrix of proposed minimum spanning tree
        expected_weight: weight of the minimum spanning tree of the full graph
        allowed_error: allowed difference between proposed MST weight and `expected_weight`

    example, how many edges should a minimum spanning tree have? Are minimum spanning trees
    always connected? What else can you think of?
